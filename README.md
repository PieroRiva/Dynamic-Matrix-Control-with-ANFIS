# Dynamic-Matrix-Control-with-ANFIS

This is a Matlab script based on 2 scripts from my page that trains a 4 Input ANFIS for the blimp model to control speed in the X axis. This script trains the ANFIS, saves the trained parameters and uses them for the proposed control strategy in a simulation loop. 

For further information my undergraduate thesis is in this repository.
